    <p>Holding Out For A Hero<br>
        Where have all good men gone<br>
        And where are all the gods?<br>
        Where's the street-wise Hercules<br>
        To fight the rising odds?<br>
        Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?<br>
        Late at night I toss and turn and dream of what I need</p>
        
        <p>I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br>
        He's gotta be strong<br>
        And he's gotta be fast<br>
        And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br>
        I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light<br>
        He's gotta be sure<br>
        And it's gotta be soon<br>
        And he's gotta be larger than life<br>
        Larger than life</p>
        
        <p>Somewhere after midnight<br>
        In my wildest fantasy<br>
        Somewhere just beyond my reach<br>
        There's someone reaching back for me<br>
        Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat<br>
        It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet</p>
        
        <p>I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br>
        He's gotta be strong<br>
        And he's gotta be fast<br>
        And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br>
        I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light<br>
        He's gotta be sure<br>
        And it's gotta be soon<br>
        And he's gotta be larger than life<br>
        I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night</p>
        
        <p>Up where the mountains meet the heavens above<br>
        Out where the lightning splits the sea<br>
        I could swear that there's someone somewhere watching me<br>
        Through the wind and the chill and the rain<br>
        And the storm and the flood<br>
        I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood<br>
        (Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)<br>
        (Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)</p>
        
        <p>I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night<br>
        He's gotta be strong<br>
        And he's gotta be fast<br>
        And he's gotta be fresh from the fight<br>
        I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light<br>
        He's gotta be sure<br>
        And it's gotta be soon<br>
        And he's gotta be larger than life<br>
        I need a hero<br>
        I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night</p>
